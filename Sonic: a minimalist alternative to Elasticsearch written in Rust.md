##### « Sonic » is the mascot of the Sonic project. Valerian drew it to look like a psychedelic hipster hedgehog.

Database implementation sits in a nice spot between computer science and software engineering. There are lot of tradeoffs to consider. That is why nowadays we have a plethora of databases, each of them useful in a particular scenario. In the projects we work on at [LambdaClass](https://lambdaclass.com/) we always end up using the following: Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Kafka and Riak or Cassandra. It is difficult to keep up with the number of databases that are needed and it is even more difficult to learn about their internals.
