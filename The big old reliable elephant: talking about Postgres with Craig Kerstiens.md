# The big old reliable elephant: talking about Postgres with Craig Kerstiens

In this opportunity I interviewed Craig Kerstiens. Craig works for [citusdata](https://www.citusdata.com/), a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming. To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many [data types](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2014/05/07/Postgres-datatypes-the-ones-youre-not-using/), [extensions](http://railsware.com/blog//2012/04/23/postgresql-most-useful-extensions/), [window functions](http://postgresguide.com/sql/window.html), [common table expressions](http://postgresguide.com/cool/ctes.html), [foreign data wrappers](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/08/05/a-look-at-FDWs/). As Craig said in one of this talks “Postgres is the Emacs of databases”. If you have ever used Emacs you know that learning it can take some time due to the number of choices available.

Craig helped me decide what postgres features to use and how, thanks to [his blog](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/content/), [postgresguide.com](http://www.postgresguide.com/) and [postgresweekly.com](https://postgresweekly.com/). He has been really helpful in sharpening my postgres knife.
