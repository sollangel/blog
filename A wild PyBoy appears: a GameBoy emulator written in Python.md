# A wild PyBoy appears: a GameBoy emulator written in Python

Most of us would be lying if we said the idea of making an emulator hasnâ€™t crossed our mind, but usually when you start digging into everything that is involved it becomes a bit overwhelming and the idea stops sparking joy, so we ditch it as soon as some other shiny thing appears. On the other hand, we have the brave people that take on this task and work on it until completion (or at least until having something decent enough to show) which by itself is an amazing accomplishment.
Most emulators are written in a system programming language (C, C++, Rust, etc), but every now and then we find a hidden gem, not only using a different language, but that evolved into something more. In this case, we found [PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy) a GameBoy emulator written in Python with a new found focus on making the external components available to bots or AI.

We interviewed one of the creators of PyBoy, [Mads Ynddal](https://github.com/Baekalfen).
