# Lasp: a little further down the Erlang rabbithole

A few years ago I found [Lasp](https://lasp-lang.readme.io/docs): _“a suite of libraries aimed at providing a comprehensive programming system for planetary scale Elixir and Erlang applications”_. At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed systems and Erlang. After playing a little bit with Lasp I watched a few talks by its creator: [Christopher Meiklejohn](https://twitter.com/cmeik). After watching his talk [“Distributed, Eventually Consistent Computations”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKaNDj4TrE) I decided it was time to interview Christopher.
Reach me via twitter at [@unbalancedparen](http://twitter.com/unbalancedparen) if you have any comments or interview request for [This is not a Monad tutorial](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial/). **Stay tuned!**
