At [LambdaClass](http://lambdaclass.com/) and our blog [This is not a Monad tutorial](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial/) we are a big fans of exploring new topics, different operating systems, platforms, languages and libraries/frameworks. We have been talking in our company about exploring new subjects like protocols.

There is a whole generation of developers that has only worked with HTTP, ReST and JSON. While a partial improvement over previous technologies, it has created a protocol monoculture. There are situations where other protocols are better suited but many of the young bloods don’t even know they exist.

MQTT is the first protocol we want to dive into. For us VerneMQ ([https://vernemq.com/](https://vernemq.com/) and [https://github.com/erlio/vernemq](https://github.com/erlio/vernemq)) is one of the best MQTT brokers implementations we know and it is familiar to us since it is implemented in Erlang. The questions were answered by [André Fatton](https://twitter.com/frescosecco), [André Graf](https://twitter.com/der_graf) and [Lars Hesel Christensen](https://twitter.com/larshesel).
