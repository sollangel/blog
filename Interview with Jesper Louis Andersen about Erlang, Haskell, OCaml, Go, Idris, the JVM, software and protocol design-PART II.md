 # Interview with Jesper Louis Andersen about Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Idris, the JVM, software and protocol design â€” PART II

This is part II of the interview with [Jesper Louis Andersen](https://twitter.com/jlouis666). You can read [part I here.](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial/interview-with-jesper-louis-andersen-about-erlang-haskell-ocaml-go-idris-the-jvm-software-and-b0de06440fbd#.4gidstolk) This part of the interview is mostly about Erlang, one of my favorite languages. If you want to learn Erlang, take a look at [Spawned Shelter](http://spawnedshelter.com/), a website I made for Erlang newcomers.
