Part I of this article](https://notamonadtutorial.com/holiday-ping-how-we-implemented-our-first-open-source-app-with-erlang-and-clojurescript-fad5b66fc325) discussed the motivation to build [HolidayPing](http://holidayping.lambdaclass.com/) and the design and development process of the back end Erlang application.
