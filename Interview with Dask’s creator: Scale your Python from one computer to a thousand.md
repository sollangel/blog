# **Interview with Dask’s creator: Scale your Python from one computer to a thousand**



My love for building distributed systems with Erlang, databases and fetching huge volumes of data still lives on. But nowadays I want to have better theoretical and practical tools to understand the data. That is why I have been seriously studying probability, statistics and getting better at Python, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy and R. If you have read my earlier interviews you are probably aware of this.

That is why I decided to interview Dask’s creator Matthew Rocklin. Dask is a great bridge between the two areas that we specialize at my company [LambdaClass](https://lambdaclass.com/): distributed systems and data science. Dask is a great tool to parallelize python libraries. When you have some spare time I highly recommend that you check its code. Meanwhile I leave you with Matthew’s answers.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I’ve created a Not a Monad Tutorial [Telegram channel](https://t.me/notamonadtutorial) to discuss about software in general. See you there!
