After our [last interview with Brian McKenna](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial/interview-with-brian-mckenna-about-roy-purescript-haskell-idris-and-dependent-types-63bb1289ea3d) for [This is not a Monad tutorial](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial) we interviewed [Nenad Rakocevic](https://github.com/dockimbel), creator of the [Red](http://www.red-lang.org/) programming language.

From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad. For example, I am not aware of many high-level languages which features an embedded DSL for general-purpose low-level programming or that have 50 native types. You should check it out, you might find some interesting ideas inside Red development.

Reach me via twitter at @unbalancedparen if you have any comment or interview request for This is not a Monad tutorial. Stay tuned!

Please tell us a little bit about Red’s inception. Why was it created?

I started programming micro-computers, an Amiga in my case, in my teens. I have now been programming for more than 30 years. After my early experiences, I was unhappy with existing programming languages and tools. This was mostly because I found them not productive or friendly enough for my taste. So, when I stumbled across the Rebol language, in 1999, it was an eye-opener on what was wrong with so called “modern” computing practice. (Nowadays it’s even worse). Fighting complexity on all software fronts became the logical course of action.
