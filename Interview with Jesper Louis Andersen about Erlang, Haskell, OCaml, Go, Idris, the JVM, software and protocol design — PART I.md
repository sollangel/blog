# Interview with Jesper Louis Andersen about Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Idris, the JVM, software and protocol design — PART I


In this occasion we interviewed Jesper Louis Andersen, a type theorist with lot of practical knowledge and experience. His [blog](https://medium.com/@jlouis666) (you should also check his old [blog](http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/), you will find a lot of good things over there) and code (specially things like [safetyvalve](https://github.com/jlouis/safetyvalve) and [fuse](https://github.com/jlouis/fuse)) have been a big inspiration to me. That is why I published the interview in two parts: I had too many questions for him. I hope you enjoy reading his answers as much as I did.

 **Your reply to the picture that is below was:**

> *The typical applications I write in Erlang have 3–4 functions above it in the call stack*
