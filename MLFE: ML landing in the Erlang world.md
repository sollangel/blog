# MLFE: ML landing in the Erlang world

Time has passed since our last interview for [This is not a Monad Tutorial](http://notamonadtutorial.com/). OpenBSD released its 6.0 version after 20 years of continues releases without agile, OpenSSL vulnerabilities keep on breeding, [Pornhub war against ad blockers continued](http://blog.bugreplay.com/post/152579164219/pornhubdodgesadblockersusingwebsockets), the Macbook Pro is not that Pro anymore, a new javascript package manager was released by Facebook and last but not least Brexit and Trump are a reality that will shape the new world order.

Going back to our endogamic tech world, I interviewed [Jeremy Pierre](http://noisycode.com/) about [MLFE](https://github.com/j14159/mlfe) or ML Flavoured Erlang. After learning Haskell and after playing with Elm I became quite a fan of ADTs and Hindley-Milner type systems so that is why I am really exited by MLFE. So I think this is a way to counterbalance my love for Lisp languages. Letâ€™s add a little bit of ML into our coffee. One of the projects I had in my To Do list was to implement an ML like language on top of the Erlang VM/BEAM. Instead of recreating the wheel, I hope to see further by standing upon the shoulders of MLFE. The invasion has began!

Au revoir.
