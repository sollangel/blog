# A Pythonist finds a new home at Clojure land

Welcome back to another interview of [Not a Monad Tutorial](https://notamonadtutorial.com/). In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a [diverse experience](https://github.com/facundoolano). We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. [Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie](https://notamonadtutorial.com/indie-languages-interview-pixie-and-timothy-baldridge-cadbc36418dc), a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.
