Like our [previous interviewee](https://notamonadtutorial.com/inteview-with-thomas-wiecki-about-probabilistic-programming-and-pymc-66a12b6f3f2e) [Osvaldo Martin](https://twitter.com/aloctavodia) is one of the developers of PyMC3 and ArviZ. He is a researcher specialized in Bayesian statistics and data science. He will be speaking at our [BuzzConf](https://github.com/lambdaclass/buzzconf) this year. I hope you like this interview as much as we did!
