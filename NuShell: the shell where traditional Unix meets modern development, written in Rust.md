## We interviewed its creators

Shells have been around forever and, for better or for worse, havenâ€™t changed much since their inception. Until [NuShell](https://www.nushell.sh/) appeared to reinvent shells and defy our muscle memory. It brought some big changes, which include rethinking how pipelines work, structured input/output, and plugins.

We wanted to learn more about NuShell so we interviewed both of its creators: [Jonathan Turner](https://twitter.com/jntrnr) and [Yehuda Katz](https://twitter.com/wycats).

## **Why create NuShell? Is it me or does it have a next-level AWK vibe?**

**Jonathan Turner**: Sometimes the simplest ideas are the ones that hook you the most :). When Yehuda and I first started discussing how shells could be improved, we settled on the idea of using structured data rather than just text between applications (for example stdin/stdout). He had just been experimenting with PowerShell and saw how adding some structure to the data opened up a lot of possibilities.
