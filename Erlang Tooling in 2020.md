The _vox populi_ is that Erlang tooling has always been lagging behind other languages’, and that when Elixir came along, it somewhat forced the community into action. Whatever the exact causes, it’s true today that Erlang has been benefiting from cross-pollination with the new communities that are building systems around the BEAM platform.

One of these fruits is the new rebar3 plugin adding a formatter to Erlang. The project’s initiator, Brujo, wrote a [blog post](http://tech.nextroll.com/blog/dev/2020/02/25/erlang-rebar3-format.html) when it was presented. We asked him some follow-up questions.
