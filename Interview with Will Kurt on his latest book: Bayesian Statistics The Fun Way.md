# **Interview with** Will Kurt on his latest book: Bayesian Statistics The Fun Way


![](https://miro.medium.com/max/544/1*LDJcJQMeyOPU9lqAs98JBQ.jpeg?q=20)


Like most devs, I have a diverse set of interests: functional programming, operating systems, type systems, distributed systems, and data science. That is why I was excited when I learned that [Will Kurt](https://twitter.com/willkurt), the author of [_Get Programming with Haskell,_](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell)  wrote a a bayesian statistics book that is being published by No Starch Press. There aren’t many people that write books on different topics. I was sure that Will had something interesting to share in this new book. I wasn’t disappointed. The book is an excellent introduction, specially for those of us that have a rough time with advanced math but that want to advance in the data science field. I recommend reading the book after reading Think Stats, but before reading Bayesian Methods for Hackers, Bayesian Analysis with Python and Doing Bayesian Data Analysis.

If you like the interview I recommend that you also read the interviews we did with [Thomas Wiecki](https://notamonadtutorial.com/inteview-with-thomas-wiecki-about-probabilistic-programming-and-pymc-66a12b6f3f2e) and [Osvaldo Martin](https://notamonadtutorial.com/interview-with-osvaldo-martin-about-bayesian-analysis-with-python-a696b2bce3ba) about Bayesian analysis and probabilistic programming.

Finally I wanted to thank two members of my team (Pablo Amoroso and Juan Bono) for helping me with the interview.
